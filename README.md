# VKOGA
Python implementation of the VKOGA algorithm.


## Usage:
The algorithm is implemented as a [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) `Estimator`, and it can be used via the `fit` and `predict` methods.

The best way to start using the algorithm is having a look at the [demo Notebook](demo.ipynb). 

The demo can also be executed online on Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/gabriele.santin%2Fvkoga/master?filepath=demo.ipynb)
